<h2>Precepts</h2>

We used to teach precepts in the past EE209 courses. In precepts, you learn auxilliary materials required to do the programming assignments (e.g., Linux commands, gcc, gdb, Makefile, etc.). However, we do not teach precepts anymore as these contents have become a separate course, **EE485: Introduction to Environments and Tools for Modern Software Development**, and you are highly encouraged to take this 1-credit, letter grade (A-F) course.

If you want to browse the old slides, here is [the link](/assets/EE485_old.zip).
